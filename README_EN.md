# ðŸ§  NeuroATM + TinyNN â€” Prototype of an Interpretable Learning AI System

This project demonstrates a **hybrid neural architecture** combining:
- `TinyNN`: a minimal neural network that encodes input into a compact context vector
- `NeuroATM`: a simple associative memory that learns through feedback and chooses actions

ðŸŽ¯ **Goal:** Build an **adaptive and interpretable AI system** that learns without gradient-based optimization â€” and avoids black-box behavior.

## ðŸš€ Features
- Training on 100 synthetic samples (ground truth: `x[0] * x[1] > 0`)
- Compared against a random agent
- Generalization test on unseen data
- Visualizations of cumulative success over time

## ðŸ›  How to Use
1. Go to [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com)
2. Upload `NeuroATM_Extended_Test.ipynb`
3. Run each cell step-by-step
